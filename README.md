# CS370Proj
CSB Gangsters

Introduction: Our project contains the framework for what eventually will be a website for a tutoring centor that has online tutors teaching via Microsoft Teams.
Currently we have implemented a backend using JavA spring Boot framework, and have implemented a front end using Javascript, HTML, and JSON. At our projects current state
we have a working web server that allows you to add tutors containing a name and a link. Once a tutor is added you are able to either add more tutors, delete a tutor, 
change tutor names, and see the complete list of tutors. You are also able to toggle the tutors status between offline and online.
